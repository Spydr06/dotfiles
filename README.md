In addition, I've included the following things:

## Installation
This repository is mostly set up like your $HOME folder.

### a) To install my themes, enter the following shell commands:
```bash
cd ~/Downloads    # cd into a non-critical directory (Downloads for example)
```
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/spydr06/dotfiles.git dotfiles-spydr
cd dotfiles-spydr
```
Now you can copy all the configs you want to use in their corresponding directories.
###### Note, that I do not provide any kind of warranty or technical support. Do all of this at your own risk and make backups of your data before modifying your system.

### b) To install my custom dwm-version:
Although the installation does not differ from the default dwm installation process, you can follow the installation instructions on my [DWM repository](https://github.com/spydr06/dwm-spydr).

### Important:
As this repository represents a copy of my $HOME folder, configurations will definately change in the future. To get all configs safely, I suggest you to download the exact version of my configurations you want over at the [releases tab](https://github.com/Spydr06/dotfiles/releases).
